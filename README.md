The Data Preprocessing I. Description of Data

II. Info about the data

III. Check if the data has missing values or not

IV. Detecting outliers

V. The Correlation between the attributes

VI. Features Selection using SelectKBest

VII. CHeck if the data balanced or not

VIII. The attributes that are most correlated with the Price Range ( Our target )

Applyed Models : (1) Logistic Regression

(2) Decision Tree(gini)

(3) Random Forest

(4) KNN

(5) Naive Bayes

(6) LSVM

Hyperparameters W used GridSearch algorithm to select the best hyperparameters for our models and get the best result for every model we used .

Conclusion We compared the accuracies of all the models and found that LSVM is the best classifier for our project
