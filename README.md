# Mobile Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the "Mobile Price Prediction" repository, where we delve into the fascinating world of predictive modeling to forecast mobile phone prices. This project encompasses a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, model application, and hyperparameter optimization, culminating in the identification of the most effective predictive model.

## Data Preprocessing Overview

Data preprocessing is a critical step in ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of our models. Our process includes:

1. **Description of Data**: Understanding the structure and type of data we are working with.
2. **Data Information**: Gaining insights into the data, including the number of features and records.
3. **Missing Value Analysis**: Checking for and addressing missing values in the dataset.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers that can skew our model predictions.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring the relationships between different attributes in the data.
6. **Feature Selection**: Employing SelectKBest for choosing the most significant features for our models.
7. **Data Balancing Check**: Assessing if the dataset is balanced and taking steps to address any imbalance.
8. **Target Correlation**: Identifying the attributes most correlated with the Price Range, our target variable.

## Applied Models

We have applied a range of machine learning models to predict mobile prices accurately:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree (Gini Index)**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
5. **Naive Bayes**
6. **Linear Support Vector Mach
